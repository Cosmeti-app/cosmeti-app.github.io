### How Cosmetify Works
Cosmetify enables seamless overlaying of cosmetic Parts onto user-uploaded Minecraft skins. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Uploading the Base Skin:**
   - Users upload a base Minecraft skin as a **64x64 PNG** file. This base skin serves as the canvas for all cosmetic Parts.

2. **Overlaying Custom Parts:**
   - Each cosmetic Part must be a **64x64 PNG** with transparent pixels.
   - The system overlays Parts onto the base skin, rendering only the visible (non-transparent) areas.
   - **Transparency Management:** Pixels using the hex color `#69764a` will convert to fully transparent, allowing for perfect blending.

3. **Final Skin Rendering:**
   - Users can preview their custom skin in real-time and download the completed design with all Parts applied seamlessly.

<summary>**üìù Submission Requirements**</summary>

### 1. Transparency
- Ensure only the cosmetic addition is visible, with the rest of the image transparent.
- **Important:** Using `#69764a` in your Part will convert those pixels to full transparency when integrated with the skin.

### 2. Image Size
- Submit your Part as a **64x64 PNG** file. This size is the standard for Minecraft skins and must be adhered to.

### 3. Naming Conventions
- **Part Name:** Under **18 characters** for easy display.
- **Author Name:** Under **8 characters** to ensure proper crediting.
